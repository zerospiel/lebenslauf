I'm a SWE with nearly 6 years of extensive experience in Go, with expertise ranging from designing high-load services capable of sustaining over 1 million QPS, to implementing robust features on Kubernetes (with some help from controllers, pollers, CRDs, and other amazing features provided by Kubernetes).

I also have a diverse background that includes developing pure business microservices using message queues, S3-compatible storage, caches, and databases, as well as platform and infrastructure-related code. I've had some experience managing a team, but that was in my native language, so don't count on it.

I love gRPC, Protobuf, Kubernetes and am eager to share my knowledge with the team.

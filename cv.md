## <div style="text-align: center">About 👨‍💻 </div>

___

Software Developer with more than 4+ years of production experience. I'm passionate about Golang (since late 2013 when I'd dug in Docker™ source code for my thesis), product development as well as research and achieving objectives related to infrastructure and clouds.

I've been working for 3+ years mainly with such products and technologies: Kubernetes, gRPC, Containers, Load Balancing, Protobuf, Ceph, Kafka, PostgreSQL. In addition, I've touched a little bit on distributed tracing (Jaeger and OpenTracing) and general observability approaches with related technologies (ELK, Prometheus and Thanos, Grafana, Graylog).

One of my main achievements was my personal desire to switch from product to platform development, where I've proven myself by quickly learning in my free time, and putting new knowledge into developing systems like service discovery and PaaS.

Currently, I'm eager to switch back to product software development, designing and implementing features for high-loaded services.

### __Senior Development Engineer__

<p><sup>01 Mar 2022 - current (1 year+) </sup></p>

__Skills__: Cloud Development • Cloud Applications • Go • Kubernetes

Part of a team working on one of the main company's projects: Mirantis Container Cloud (MCC).

My main objective is to design the best user experience in deploying Kubernetes clusters on public and private clouds, on-premise infrastructure, and bare metal.

To achieve this goal, I've been designing the pieces of architecture, developing k8s controllers, and provided with a wide range of tests (from unit to end-to-end ones) covering the functionality, while actively communicating with designers and frontend engineers.

I've been primarily working with Go, Kubernetes, different cloud providers (Azure, AWS, Openstack), and some extra tools and technologies, such as Python, JS, and Jenkins.

## [__SberTech__](https://sbertech.ru)

SberTech is a technology branch of one of the biggest banks in CIS, which specialization is lying in IT R&D, Platforms, Machine Learning, etc.

Ozon is a leading multi-category e-commerce platform with more than 180 000 active merchants and 32.7 million buyers.

### __Lead Core Platform Engineer__

<p><sup>May 2020 - Dec 2021 (1 year 8 months) </sup></p>

__Skills__: Platform Development • Site Reliability Engineering • Ceph • Protocol Buffers • Kubernetes • gRPC

The main objective was to reduce time-to-market for features, generalize the approach to the development process, and improve the experience for all company's software engineers by providing the best all-in-one platform as a service.

Implementing projects in Go, Python, C#. Solo and in collaboration with teammates.

Worked on and with the following amazing projects:

- Service discovery and control plane integration;
- PoC and an early version of managed Ceph front-end service (solo);
- L7 balancing with various algorithms (client-side);
- xDS (envoy API) implementation and adoption within an internal corporate control plane (solo);
- Protobuf workflow automation and end-user simplification (solo);
- Implementation and support of platform libraries (caches, Redis, Postgres, middleware, metrics, etc.) and SDKs;
- gRPC debugging and some optimizations;
- touched a bit of tracing (opentracing, jaeger, opentelemetry).

Extra bits of tools that I've worked with: helm charts, ci/cd (gitlab), k8s tuning (client-side only).

Led a team of 3 members (senior, middle, and trainee) for several months.

### __Software Developer__

<p><sup>Feb. 2019 - May 2020 (1 year 4 months) </sup></p>

__Skills__: Algorithms • Go • PostgreSQL • Redis • Apache Kafka

I've been implementing a variety of business ideas in PoC, which then were tested and analyzed. And in case of success, the development of a product continues in a more convenient way: optimization of the architecture, code refactoring, improving the user experience, and applying modern patterns. The main idea of the role was to be a SWAT of development.

Implemented more than 20 business services using tools such as

- postgresql;
- kafka;
- redis;
- memcached;
- etcd

The most significant projects that I've done with my team and which were released and successfully generated profits:

- AB tests: hundreds of company's business managers integrated, thousands of experiments, and (probably) tens of millions saved and earned;
- Recommendations system: the bread and butter of any e-commerce business;
- Referral program: two versions, thousands of hundreds of users, at least millions of profits for them;
- Other company-specific business services

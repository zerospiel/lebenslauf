## <div style="text-align: center">About üë®‚Äçüíª </div>

___

I'm passionate about Golang (since late 2013 when I'd dug in Docker‚Ñ¢ source code), product development as well as research and achieving objectives related to infrastructure and clouds.

I've been working for several years mainly with such products and technologies: Kubernetes, gRPC, Containers, Load Balancing, Protobuf, Ceph, Kafka, PostgreSQL. In addition, I've touched a little bit on distributed tracing (Jaeger and OpenTracing) and general observability approaches with related technologies (ELK, Prometheus and Thanos, Grafana, Graylog).

One of my main achievements was switching from product to platform development, where I've proven myself learning quickly by myself, and putting new knowledge into developing systems like service discovery and PaaS.

__Skills__: Cloud Development ‚Ä¢ Cloud Applications ‚Ä¢ Go ‚Ä¢ Kubernetes

Part of a team working on one of the main company's projects: Mirantis Container Cloud (MCC).

My main objective is to design the best user experience in deploying Kubernetes clusters on public and private clouds, on-premise infrastructure, and bare metal.

To achieve this goal, I've been designing the pieces of architecture, developing k8s controllers, and provided with a wide range of tests (from unit to end-to-end ones) covering the functionality, while actively communicating with designers and frontend engineers.

I've been primarily working with Go, Kubernetes, different cloud providers (Azure, AWS, Openstack), and some extra tools and technologies, such as Python, JS, and Jenkins.
